# Sunshine_Arm_Control
2015 CSNE Hackathon - Sunshine Army

Team Sunshine Army used a Myo armband to control the motions of an OWI Edge robotic arm we assembled during the hackathon.
The Myo processed EMG data to determine gestures being performed by the user. Combinations of gestures were incorporated 
into a state machine which decided what commands to send to the robotic arm through an Intel Galileo microprocessor
